Given the complexity of some of the tasks in future assignments, it is recommended to have a good IDE that can do basic things such as code completion, linting, formatting etc. I am giving some instructions based on VS Code that I personally use. Each of the features listed below are also available in other major IDEs for Python. You can emulate some of these through an internet search.

In a typical enterprise environment, it is not unheard of for an application to be running for years if not decades. A recent exhibit came during the CrowdStrike debacle when SouthWest airlines in USA (a budget carrier like Indigo) was not affected because their system runs on Windows 3.1 which came in 1992. Even if that is an extreme case, it is imperative to make sure that your code runs for a few years.\n",

    "### Recommendation: Avoid Using the Python Installation in Your Operating System \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Linux or macOS, it is likely that your OS already comes with Python. A rookie mistake is to start using this version for your projects. This version is typically designed for OS tools. So, it is likely that it is using an older version of Python. For example, even though I have the latest version of macOS (Sonoma, as Sequoia is not yet released), the Python version is 3.9 which was released 3-4 years ago whereas Python 3.13 is going to be released in October. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using an older version is bad for many reasons. First, you will not have the latest cool functionalities that the vibrant Python community is developing. Second, faster-cpython project has been steadily making the interpreter fast. So you are missing out on potential performance improvement where you do not need to do anything :) Finally, lot of libraries we will use might not even work with old Python versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that we are doing data science stuff, a good rule-of-thumb is to always use one version behind the latest stable release. For example, if the latest version is 3.X, then use 3.(X-1). The reason is that it takes few months before major DS libraries (PyTorch being the most notorious example) make it work seamlessly for the new version. Of course, if you do not use lot of DS stuff, stick with the latest version. By a quirk of timing, we will be using Python 3.12 even though it is the latest version. The reason is that Python 3.13 will be released in October and 3.12 was released a year before that - so most vendors have had a lot of time to make their libraries work for 3.12 . \n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation: Install Python With Tools That Support Multiple Versions\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the latest version is just one part of the puzzle. As Python keeps improving, we will need to use more recent versions. However, it is possible that your old DS projects rely on the old Python versions (this case is surprisingly common). So, when installing Python, do not simply go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/) and run the installer in that website. You should use a more sophisticated tool that allows you to install multiple Python versions. This is a surprisingly complex task to do on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two most common tools for this are [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/). I regularly use pyenv. In an enterprise environment, I would recommend you to use pyenv. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our course, we will take a more complex approach that I think will become standardized in the future. We will using a very powerful tool called [Rye](https://rye.astral.sh/) that can do this and more. \n"

    "Python has a very fragmented development ecosystem.

There has been some efforts to build \"Cargo for Python\" and it might take couple of years before it matures. \n",

    "[Rye](https://rye.astral.sh/) is the new kid on the block that has become extremely popular even though it is quite new and also experimental. My original plan for the assignment was to use a combination of [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/). Some of the recent features added to Rye makes it easier to use it as a single tool that can do setting up multiple Python versions and setting up virtual environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is unlikely that Rye becomes the dominant tool but its design principles (using other tools such as `uv`, `pdm`, `pip-tools` etc instead of building yet another tool) ensures that the eventual tool will reuse most of its ideas. Rye has been adopted by [Astral](https://astral.sh/) that has excellent track record in dev tooling systems including `Ruff` and `uv`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular library for virtual environments is [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). It pioneered many of the techniques that is used by Rye, PDM and Hatch.

    "3. Optionally, please take a look at the `pyproject.toml`. This file has become the dominant way in which project related information is specified. Many of the tools will use the information in this file to behave differently. For example, `requires-python` controls which Python interpreters can be used to run this project. The `dependencies` and `dev-dependencies` will be used by libraries such as Rye, PDM, Poetry etc to install the dependencies. You can see that I have done additional customizations (such as `tool.rye.scripts` to create some new Rye commands) or `tool.ruff.lint` to control which error messages to ignore. Mastering the pyproject.toml is an underappreciated skill in becoming a good data scientist. A great resource is the [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/). \n",

    "\n",
    "A natural, but incorrect, approach is to use `pip`. The issue is that blindly installing the package using pip will result in some of the same issues discussed above. They are often tied to a fixed Python version. So a library that you installed for Python 3.11 might not be available for Python 3.12. Even worse, installing a library might bump the version of some other dependent library and break a third library. So the modern approach is to use `pipx` that installs a library and all its dependent libraries in a self-contained environment. This allows that library to operate independently and ensures that it will keep working even if you upgrade other libraries. \n",

The TAs will have access to the grader with the private test cases which will be a superset of public test cases. \n",
