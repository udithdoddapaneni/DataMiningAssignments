    "TOML is a powerful language and becoming widely used especially in the Python ecosystem. Most of the important libraries are using TOML to share their configurations. For example, pyproject.toml that we used for customizing the setup is a TOML file. An indication of its importance is the fact that Python provides mechanisms to work with TOML as part of its standard library. So, the importance of TOML is only going to increase from hereon. So it is essential that a budding data scientist is fluent with TOML. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the link above to learn about TOML. It is a reasonably good intro to TOML. Usually, you will only need to parse a TOML file. So tomllib does not provide a way to dump a TOML string. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have found that a good way to learn a markup language is to write a translator. So we will build a translator that takes Python dictionary as input and outputs TOML. \n",
    "\n",
    "TOML supports lot of data types. For this assignment, let us limit ourselves where the scalars are integers and strings. We will support lists and dictionaries as complex entities where the values will be either integers, strings or lists and dictionaries (ie nested data structures). \n",
    "\n",
    "Please update the function `t2c_python_dict_to_toml_string` in `t2_tasks.py` with your code. We provide two simple dictionaries to test your code -- `t2c_simple_dict` and `t2c_complex_dict`. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can test your code by running rye with the pytest marker `t2c`\n",
    "\n",
    "> rye test -- -m t2c\n",
    "\n",
    "It goes without saying that you cannot use any existing TOML library and call its dumps function. During grading, the TAs will have a custom pyproject.toml that will not include such libraries :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the TAs grading code will contain additional private test cases that is not much more complex than the two given here."
